    <p>
      hi, I'm Henry, and I'm here to talk about like being positive to yourself
    </p>
    <p>
      so sometimes you treat yourself like awesome, that's great cause like
      you're good yourself. But then sometimes you think you're not good at
      something which is also okay But right now I'm just here to talk about
      being positive to yourself☺️
    </p>
    <h2>lesson one be proud of yourself</h2>
    <p> so, I'm here to talk about being positive and that includes being proud of yourself.
      Being proud of yourself is it always as easy as you think, but then when you try it's as easy as cake
      And when you're proud of yourself, you're positive so it equals like this equation
      proud = positive
    </p>
    <h2> lesson two be kind
    </h2><p> so being kind is a big part of being kind is being positive. And positive it's being kind.
      Which also brings us a equation. Kind = positive.
      So being kind is helping each other cheering them on and basically being respectful.
    </p>
    <h2> lesson three, don't get mad just get along</h2><p> so you can sometimes get very disappointed in yourself.
      Like when you fail a quiz, or you do something wrong. But sometimes ends up making you very mad and disappointed .and here comes to a simple question how do you stop yourself from being mad?
      Well, we sometimes have a lot of ways:
      <ul>
        <li>Taking deep breaths</li>
        <li>Doing a hobby</li>
        <li>Or just take your mind off it</li>
      </ul>
      But sometimes it's hard
      Cause like you can't always just do those things and not get mad I mean it's a lot more complex sometimes like you know being angry and sad at the same time then it's more difficult
      And it's harder. But if you just try it work.
